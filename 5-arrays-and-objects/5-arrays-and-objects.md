# Arrays and Objects

## Arrays

An array is a data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a collection of elements.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
const mixedArray = [1, 'hello', true, { key: 'value' }]
```

### Usage of Arrays

- Ordered collection
- Data of similar type

## Objects

A complex data type that allows you to store a collection of key-value pairs.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York',
}
```

### Usage of Objects

- Storing key-value pairs
- Named keys

## JSON

Commonly used for configuration files, data exchange between a server and a web application, and storing structured data.

```json
{
“name”: “Alice”,
“age”: “30”,
“city”: “New York”,
}
```

### Usage of JSON

- Widely used due to readability and compatibility
- Can be easily parsed by JavaScript on the client side
- Client-side applications can send data to the server in JSON format
